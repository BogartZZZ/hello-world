# hello-world
beginner tradition
Beginner programmer with a Bachelor's in Software Programming looking for that one opportunity to make a difference.
I'm a father of a wonderful daughter who was diagnosed with Autism just before 2 years old.
I love to play golf, ice hockey, gaming, and enjoy the Colorado life.
I also referee ice hockey games on the weekend.
