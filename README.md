# hello-world

Software Quality Engineer with a Bachelor's in Software Programming looking for that one opportunity to make a difference.
I'm a father of a wonderful daughter who was diagnosed with Autism just before 2 years old, in my free time I enjoy tinkering with computers, playing video games, ice hockey, golf, bbq and just sit on the deck and enjoy the Colorado life.
